Project Overview
Project Details

	 In this project, you will play detective, and put your new skills to use by building a person of interest identifier based on financial and email data made public as a result of the Enron scandal. 

	 To assist you in your detective work, we've combined this data with a hand-generated list of persons of interest in the fraud case, which means individuals who were indicted, reached a settlement or plea deal with the government, or testified in exchange for prosecution immunity.

	 poi_id.py: 

	 	write your analysis here

	tester.py: 

		when when you turn in your analysis for evaluation, you will submit your algorithm, dataset, and list fo features that you use

		the evaluator will then use this code to test your result, to make sure we see performance that's similar to what you report

	emails_by_address:

		this directory contains many files, each of which contain all the messages to or from a particular email address. 

	my_dataset:
